# VCV Rack MCP - Active Development Context

## Current Focus

We're currently in Phase 3, Sprint 5 of the MCP development, focusing on creating reference implementations of providers and subscribers that demonstrate the full functionality of the framework. This includes:

1. **Reference Provider Implementation** (60% complete)
   - Created basic provider class structure
   - Implemented registration with broker
   - Completed serialization helpers for various data types
   - Implemented publishing interface
   - Working on periodic message publishing mechanism
   - Implementing data generation for example messages

2. **Reference Subscriber Implementation** (40% complete)
   - Created basic subscriber structure
   - Implemented message handling and callback functionality
   - Successfully demonstrated deserialization of various data types
   - Working on thread-safe data passing from worker thread to audio thread
   - Need to implement processing of deserialized data in audio thread context

3. **Integration Examples** (30% complete)
   - Created complete serialization example demonstrating end-to-end workflow
   - Successfully tested message publishing and receiving with serialized data
   - Need to implement comprehensive reference implementation with thread safety focus
   - Planning additional tests for more complex data types and higher message volumes

## Recent Changes

1. **Completed Serialization Implementation**
   - Successfully integrated msgpack11 library for lightweight binary serialization
   - Created and tested comprehensive serialization helpers for common data types
   - Implemented extractMessageData for type-safe deserialization
   - Developed complete serialization example demonstrating the workflow
   - Verified all serialization, broker, and publish/subscribe tests pass

2. **Successful End-to-End Message Flow**
   - Demonstrated full publish/subscribe workflow with serialized data
   - Confirmed topic registration and subscription work correctly
   - Implemented and tested serialized message publishing
   - Verified message receipt and deserialization in subscribers
   - Ensured proper cleanup of resources

## Active Development

### Technical Decisions

1. **Serialization Strategy**
   - Using msgpack11 for binary serialization due to its lightweight nature and simple API
   - Created helper functions that abstract away serialization complexity
   - Implemented type-safe interfaces for serialization and deserialization
   - Focused on common data types (strings, numbers, vectors) with easy extensibility

2. **Provider/Subscriber Design**
   - Reference implementations demonstrate proper usage patterns
   - Including error handling for serialization/deserialization failures
   - Showing lifecycle management (registration, publication, subscription, cleanup)
   - Emphasizing thread safety for cross-thread communication

3. **Testing Focus**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests showing full workflow
   - Examples serving as both documentation and validation

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete the thread-safe data passing mechanism in reference subscriber (using dsp::RingBuffer)
2. Implement periodic publishing in the reference provider
3. Create comprehensive integration tests with more complex data structures
4. Add detailed comments and documentation in the example code
5. Update API documentation to reflect the complete workflow

### Upcoming Milestones

1. **Complete Sprint 5** (Reference Implementations) - ETA: 1 week
2. **Begin Sprint 6** (Documentation) - including Developer's Guide and Best Practices
3. **Prepare for Phase 4** (Integration & Refinement) - VCV Rack integration and optimization

## Development Priorities

1. Thread safety for audio thread integration
2. Comprehensive examples for module developers
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation quality
5. Error handling robustness

## Team Communication
- Regular updates on reference implementation progress
- Discussion of best practices based on serialization example learnings
- Planning documentation structure based on implementation experience
