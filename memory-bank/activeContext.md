# VCV Rack MCP - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently at the end of **Phase 3: Reference Implementation & Documentation**, having completed:

- **Sprint 6: API Usability & Documentation** (100% complete)
  - ✅ Comprehensive topic system documentation
  - ✅ Standardized topic naming conventions
  - ✅ Catalog of standard topics with message formats
  - ✅ Topic registration process documentation
  - ✅ Best practices for implementing topics
  - ✅ Main README.md updated to reflect documentation additions

Moving to **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement**:
- **Sprint 7: Performance & Scalability Testing** (upcoming)
  - Develop performance testing scenarios
  - Benchmark MCP operations impact on audio thread
  - Test Broker performance under load
  - Optimize for performance bottlenecks

## Recent Changes

1. **Completed Sprint 6: API Usability & Documentation**
   - Created six comprehensive documentation files for the topic system:
     - `topic_naming_conventions.md`: Guidelines for creating well-formed topic names
     - `standard_topics.md`: Catalog of officially supported topics
     - `message_formats.md`: Detailed specifications for standard message formats
     - `topic_registration.md`: Process for registering new topics
     - `topic_best_practices.md`: Recommended patterns for efficient topic usage
     - `topics_documentation.md`: Index document linking all topic-related documentation
   - Updated the main README.md to reflect new documentation files
   - Refined API method documentation with improved thread-safety annotations
   - Provided clear implementation examples for common use cases

2. **Topic System Documentation Features**
   - URI-style format (`namespace/resource`) for topic names
   - Reverse domain notation for namespaces to ensure uniqueness
   - Standardized message formats for all core system topics
   - Clear registration process for different topic types
   - Implementation examples for providers and subscribers
   - Thread-safety considerations and best practices
   - Performance optimization techniques

3. **Documentation Structure Improvements**
   - Logical organization with cross-references between documents
   - Quick reference sections for common operations
   - Code examples demonstrating implementation patterns
   - Tables of standard topics organized by category
   - JSON schema examples for all standard messages

## Active Decisions

1. **Topic Naming Strategy**
   - Using reverse domain notation for namespaces (e.g., `com.vcvrack.core`)
   - Consistent formatting with lowercase and hyphens for multi-word resources
   - Version indicators in resource names for breaking changes
   - Reserved namespaces for system functionality

2. **Standard Topics Organization**
   - Core system topics using `mcp.system` namespace
   - Standard VCV Rack functionality in `com.vcvrack.core` namespace
   - Categorization by functionality (clock, MIDI, modulation, etc.)
   - Clear direction of message flow (provider → subscriber)

3. **Message Format Standardization**
   - JSON as primary format for documentation and debugging
   - MessagePack recommended for efficiency in production
   - Standard message structure with type, version, timestamp, source, and data
   - Binary data encoding guidelines for large datasets

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Begin Performance Testing**
   - Develop testing scenarios for high message volume
   - Measure impact on audio thread CPU usage
   - Identify potential bottlenecks in the Broker
   - Optimize message dispatch for efficiency

2. **Stress Test Thread Safety**
   - Develop specific tests targeting concurrency issues
   - Test under extreme conditions to verify thread-safe operation
   - Address the known RingBuffer thread safety issue
   - Improve error handling under stress conditions

3. **Refine Documentation Based on Testing**
   - Update best practices with performance findings
   - Add performance guidelines for message frequency and size
   - Document any thread-safety considerations discovered during testing

## Challenges Being Addressed

1. **Thread Safety Improvements**
   - Identified RingBuffer thread safety issue in unit tests
   - Some items consumed multiple times, others not consumed at all under high concurrency
   - Reference implementation examples still function correctly
   - Issue scheduled for resolution in Sprint 7 (upcoming)

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to formally benchmark message dispatch under load
   - Evaluate serialization/deserialization performance
   - Test with varying message sizes and frequencies
   - Optimize for real-time audio thread safety

3. **Implementation Consistency**
   - Ensuring consistent naming across the documentation
   - Maintaining compatibility with versioning strategy
   - Balancing standardization with flexibility for custom needs

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete performance and scalability testing (ETA: 2 weeks)
2. Resolve thread-safety issues (ETA: 3 weeks)
3. Finalize API stability with any refinements from testing (ETA: 4 weeks)
4. Begin SDK integration preparation (ETA: 5 weeks)

## Development Priorities

1. Performance optimization for audio thread safety
2. Thread-safety improvements, especially for RingBuffer
3. Stress testing under high-load conditions
4. SDK integration preparation
