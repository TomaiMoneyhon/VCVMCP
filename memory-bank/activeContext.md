# VCV Rack MCP - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently in **Phase 3: Reference Implementation & Documentation**, focusing on:

- **Sprint 6: Documentation** (30% complete)
  - Updating API documentation with best practices
  - Creating a comprehensive developer's guide
  - Developing integration guides for VCV Rack module developers
  - Documenting thread-safety patterns and practices

## Recent Changes

1. **Completed Sprint 5: Reference Provider & Subscriber**
   - Successfully implemented `MCPReferenceProvider` with periodic publishing
   - Implemented `MCPReferenceSubscriber` with thread-safe data passing
   - Created functional example applications demonstrating full functionality
   - Developed a mock VCV Rack framework for testing
   - Added comprehensive test suite for reference implementations
   - Demonstrated thread-safe data passing between worker and audio threads

2. **Reference Implementation Features**
   - Thread-safe ring buffer implementation for audio thread communication
   - Multi-topic subscription and registration
   - Thread identification and appropriate handling
   - Various data generation patterns (sine waves, random walks, etc.)
   - Proper lifecycle management (add/remove handling)
   - Clear visualization and monitoring of data flow
   - Resilient error handling and recovery

3. **Fixed Resource Management Issues**
   - Resolved bad_weak_ptr exceptions during program shutdown
   - Improved broker singleton lifecycle management
   - Enhanced module lifecycle handling with proper destruction sequence
   - Added safe shutdown helper function for the broker
   - Fixed shared_from_this() usage in destructors
   - Ensured proper ordering of resource cleanup

## Active Decisions

1. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Focus on real-world examples from the reference implementation
   - Include code snippets and complete examples
   - Provide thread-safety guidelines and best practices
   - Document common pitfalls and how to avoid them

2. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Define clear error reporting mechanism for serialization issues
   - Establish guidelines for error recovery
   - Document appropriate error handling patterns

3. **API Refinements**
   - Consider adding helper functions for common tasks
   - Improve function documentation with more examples
   - Document thread-safety requirements and guarantees

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete API Documentation**
   - Update all public interfaces with detailed comments
   - Add usage examples for each major function
   - Clearly document thread-safety requirements
   - Include best practices based on reference implementation

2. **Create Developer's Guide**
   - Step-by-step guide to implementing providers
   - Step-by-step guide to implementing subscribers
   - Serialization and deserialization guide
   - Thread-safety considerations and patterns

3. **Integration Guide**
   - VCV Rack-specific integration guide
   - Lifecycle management in VCV modules
   - Audio thread considerations
   - Performance optimization strategies

## Challenges Being Addressed

1. **Complete Resource Cleanup**
   - ✅ Fixed issues with bad_weak_ptr exceptions
   - ✅ Ensured proper broker cleanup
   - ✅ Verified correct shared_ptr lifetime management

2. **Thread Safety Improvements**
   - Identified RingBuffer thread safety issue in unit tests
   - Some items consumed multiple times, others not consumed at all under high concurrency
   - Reference implementation examples still function correctly
   - Issue scheduled for resolution in Sprint 7

3. **Documentation Clarity**
   - Making complex concepts clear and approachable
   - Balancing comprehensive coverage with readability
   - Ensuring documentation is useful for both beginners and experts

4. **VCV Rack Integration**
   - Planning transition from mock framework to real integration
   - Documenting differences between mock and real environment
   - Preparing for performance optimization in real-world usage

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete API documentation (ETA: 1 week)
2. Finish developer's guide (ETA: 2 weeks)
3. Create integration guide (ETA: 3 weeks)
4. Begin VCV Rack integration (ETA: 4 weeks)

## Development Priorities

1. Documentation completeness and accuracy
2. Fixing resource cleanup issues
3. Preparing for VCV Rack integration
4. Performance optimization
