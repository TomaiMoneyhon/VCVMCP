# VCV Rack MCP - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently in **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement**, working on:

- **Sprint 7: Performance & Scalability Testing** (in progress)
  - ✅ RingBuffer thread safety improvements completed
  - ✅ Comprehensive thread safety test suite developed
  - ✅ Tests consolidated for better maintainability
  - ✅ Performance benchmarking framework created
  - ✅ Updated documentation with best practices
  - ✅ Started dependency cleanup and optimization
  - ⬜ Benchmark MCP operations impact on audio thread
  - ⬜ Test Broker performance under load
  - ⬜ Further optimize remaining performance bottlenecks

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Critical RingBuffer Thread Safety Issue**
   - Identified race conditions in the original implementation through stress testing
   - Developed comprehensive test suite that reliably reproduces the issue
   - Implemented a new Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) optimized RingBuffer
   - Added proper memory ordering with sequential consistency guarantees
   - Implemented memory barriers to ensure visibility between threads
   - Verified through high-throughput stress tests (~980,000 messages/second)
   - Consolidated test suite for better maintainability
   - Verified all tests now pass with perfect reliability

2. **Developed Performance Testing Framework**
   - Created stress testing tools for concurrent operations
   - Implemented specific test cases for thread safety verification
   - Added memory ordering tests to verify correct thread visibility
   - Benchmarking suite to measure throughput and reliability
   - Test patterns for multiple distinct ring buffers (actual MCP usage pattern)
   - Performance measurement with metrics for messages per second

3. **Documentation Additions**
   - Added comprehensive RingBuffer usage pattern to systemPatterns.md
   - Updated techContext.md with details on the improved implementation
   - Created clear best practices for Single-Producer/Single-Consumer workflow
   - Updated progress.md with current status and completion percentages
   - Added buffer sizing recommendations and performance considerations

4. **Code Cleanup & Organization**
   - Removed unused msgpack-c and msgpack-cpp libraries from external/ directory
   - Consolidated duplicate test files (SPSCRingBufferTest.cpp merged into RingBufferStressTest.cpp)
   - Clarified that msgpack11 is the sole implementation for MessagePack serialization
   - Optimized test runs by focusing on relevant test cases
   - Updated CMakeLists.txt to reflect consolidated tests

## Active Decisions

1. **RingBuffer Optimization Strategy**
   - Optimized for Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) pattern
   - Using sequential consistency for memory ordering guarantees
   - Explicit memory barriers at critical points for safety
   - Simplified push/pop logic for performance
   - Clear documentation of thread safety assumptions
   - Fixed-size buffer with power-of-2 size recommendation
   - Additional slot to distinguish empty vs. full states

2. **Performance Benchmarking Approach**
   - Measuring raw throughput (messages per second)
   - Testing with multiple independent buffers to simulate actual usage
   - Validating correctness under high load (no duplicates/losses)
   - Evaluating CPU usage impact of different implementation choices
   - Memory ordering tests to verify correct visibility

3. **Best Practices Evolution**
   - Each module should have its own RingBuffer instance
   - Worker thread should be the only producer (via `onMCPMessage`)
   - Audio thread should be the only consumer (via `process()`)
   - Buffer sizing recommendations (64-128 elements for most modules)
   - Proper error handling for buffer-full conditions
   - Notification mechanism using atomic flags for signaling
   - Clear guidance on SPSC workflow

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Extend Performance Testing to Other Components**
   - Apply same rigorous testing to Broker message dispatch
   - Test provider/subscriber interactions under load
   - Measure serialization/deserialization performance
   - Identify any remaining thread safety issues

2. **Begin Integration with VCV Plugin API**
   - Prepare for SDK integration
   - Test with actual VCV Rack environment
   - Validate real-world performance characteristics
   - Refine API based on integration findings

3. **Complete Thread Safety Optimization**
   - Review all components for potential thread safety issues
   - Apply lessons learned from RingBuffer fix
   - Update documentation with comprehensive thread safety guidelines
   - Finalize best practices for module developers
