## Current Status Summary

We have successfully completed Phases 1 and 2 of the MCP development, establishing the core framework and message exchange mechanisms. The broker can now handle topic registration, subscriber management, and message dispatch with proper thread safety.

We've now also completed Phase 3 Sprint 5, delivering comprehensive reference implementations for both provider and subscriber modules. These reference implementations demonstrate:

1. Thread-safe message passing between the broker thread and audio thread
2. Proper lifecycle management for modules (onAdd/onRemove handling)
3. Efficient serialization and deserialization of various data types
4. Proper cleanup and resource management
5. Integration with a mock VCV Rack framework for testing without the actual VCV Rack environment

The reference implementations are available in several forms:
1. `MCPReferenceProvider` and `MCPReferenceSubscriber` classes with full functionality
2. Serialization example showing basic serialization capabilities
3. Reference modules example demonstrating real-time communication between modules
4. Full reference implementation showing all features working together

All example programs now run without exceptions, with proper cleanup of resources during program termination. The previously reported issue with bad_weak_ptr exceptions during shutdown has been fixed by improving lifecycle management and ensuring proper ordering of shared_ptr cleanup.

## Current Focus

Our current focus is on Sprint 6: Documentation. We need to:
1. Update API documentation to include best practices based on our reference implementation
2. Create a comprehensive developer's guide
3. Develop an integration guide for VCV Rack module developers

## Known Issues

1. âœ… Fixed: Bad_weak_ptr exception during program termination in reference implementation examples
2. Need to improve error reporting for serialization failures
3. Add timeout options for message dispatch
4. RingBuffer thread safety issue detected in unit tests - some items are consumed multiple times while others aren't consumed at all in high-concurrency scenarios (scheduled to be addressed in Sprint 7)

## Next Steps

1. Complete API documentation with best practices
2. Develop a comprehensive developer's guide
3. Create an integration guide for VCV Rack module developers
4. Polish error handling and diagnostics
5. Prepare for VCV Rack integration
