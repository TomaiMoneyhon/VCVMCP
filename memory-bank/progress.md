# VCV Rack MCP - Progress

## Current Status: Phase 1, Sprint 2 Complete (40% Implementation Complete)

The project has completed Phase 1, Sprint 2 implementation. We have successfully added subscription functionality to the broker, including the IMCPSubscriber_V1 interface and related lifecycle management. All new functionality has been thoroughly tested with an expanded suite of unit tests.

## What Works

The following components have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… Core project structure with CMake build system
- âœ… Interface definitions:
  - `IMCPBroker`: Main broker interface with registration, subscription, and discovery functions
  - `IMCPProvider_V1`: Interface for modules providing contextual information
  - `IMCPSubscriber_V1`: Interface for modules subscribing to contextual information
- âœ… Broker implementation:
  - Thread-safe singleton pattern
  - Topic registration and unregistration
  - Subscription management (subscribe, unsubscribe, unsubscribeAll)
  - Topic discovery
  - Provider lookup
- âœ… Thread safety:
  - Mutex protection for registry operations
  - Mutex protection for subscription operations
  - Proper handling of concurrent access
  - Tested with multi-threaded stress tests
- âœ… Weak reference handling:
  - Automatic cleanup of expired provider references
  - Automatic cleanup of expired subscriber references
  - Proper memory management
- âœ… Unit tests:
  - Basic functionality testing
  - Edge case handling
  - Thread safety verification
  - Subscription management testing
- âœ… Initial API documentation
- âœ… Example program demonstrating basic registry operations

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 2: Serialization & Pub/Sub Flow
- [ ] `MCPMessage_V1` structure definition
- [ ] MessagePack integration
- [ ] JSON serialization support
- [ ] Publish functionality
- [ ] Worker thread message dispatch
- [ ] Subscriber notification

### Phase 3: Reference Implementation & Docs
- [ ] Reference provider module
- [ ] Reference subscriber module
- [ ] Complete developer documentation
- [ ] API usage examples

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Thread-safety verification
- [ ] Error handling enhancement
- [ ] API stabilization

### Phase 5: SDK Integration & Release
- [ ] VCV Rack SDK integration
- [ ] Final documentation
- [ ] Release preparation

## Known Issues

No significant issues have been encountered during implementation so far. 

Potential areas to monitor:

1. **Performance Impact**: We need to ensure registry and subscription operations remain efficient even with a large number of topics and subscribers.

2. **Memory Management**: While the weak reference system works well, we should monitor for any potential memory leaks or reference cycles.

3. **Thread Safety**: Current mutex-based approach is working, but we should continually evaluate if it scales well with increased concurrency.

## Next Milestones

1. **Sprint 3: Message Structure** - Define the MCPMessage_V1 structure to prepare for adding serialization support.

2. **Sprint 3: Serialization** - Integrate MessagePack for efficient data exchange between modules.

3. **Sprint 4: Pub/Sub Flow** - Implement the publish functionality and message dispatch worker thread.

4. **Sprint 4: Subscriber Notification** - Implement the subscriber notification mechanism.
