## Current Status Summary

We have successfully completed Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the MCP development. The core framework, message exchange system, reference implementations, and comprehensive documentation are now complete.

With the completion of Sprint 6, we have delivered:

1. **Comprehensive Topic System Documentation**
   - Detailed topic naming conventions using URI-style format
   - Catalog of standard topics organized by functionality
   - Detailed message format specifications for all standard topics
   - Clear registration process for different types of topics
   - Best practices for implementing and using the topic system

2. **API Usability Improvements**
   - Enhanced documentation for all interfaces and methods
   - Improved thread-safety annotations throughout the API
   - Clear implementation patterns with code examples
   - Best practices for common usage scenarios

3. **Main README Updates**
   - Added a new "Documentation Additions" section
   - Updated the project structure to list all new documentation files
   - Enhanced the features list to include documentation components

All documentation is now complete and organized in a logical structure with cross-references between documents. The documentation is designed to be approachable for new developers while providing depth for experienced users.

## Current Focus

Our current focus is moving to Sprint 7: Performance & Scalability Testing. We need to:
1. Develop specific performance testing scenarios
2. Benchmark MCP operations impact on audio thread CPU usage
3. Test Broker performance under load
4. Identify and address performance bottlenecks
5. Address the known RingBuffer thread safety issue

## Known Issues

1. ✅ Fixed: Bad_weak_ptr exception during program termination in reference implementation examples
2. ⬜ RingBuffer thread safety issue in high-concurrency scenarios (scheduled to be addressed in Sprint 7)
3. ⬜ Need to benchmark message dispatch under load
4. ⬜ Need to formalize error handling patterns based on testing

## Next Steps

1. Begin performance and scalability testing
2. Develop stress tests for thread safety verification
3. Optimize message dispatch for efficiency
4. Address RingBuffer thread safety issue
5. Prepare for final API refinements based on testing
