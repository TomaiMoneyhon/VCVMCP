# VCV Rack MCP - Progress

## Current Status: Phase 1, Sprint 1 Complete (20% Implementation Complete)

The project has completed Phase 1, Sprint 1 implementation. We have successfully built the core broker with thread-safe topic registration/unregistration functionality and basic discovery capabilities. The implementation is fully tested with a comprehensive suite of unit tests and an example program.

## What Works

The following components have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… Core project structure with CMake build system
- âœ… Interface definitions:
  - `IMCPBroker`: Main broker interface with registration and discovery functions
  - `IMCPProvider_V1`: Interface for modules providing contextual information
- âœ… Broker implementation:
  - Thread-safe singleton pattern
  - Topic registration and unregistration
  - Topic discovery
  - Provider lookup
- âœ… Thread safety:
  - Mutex protection for registry operations
  - Proper handling of concurrent access
  - Tested with multi-threaded stress tests
- âœ… Weak reference handling:
  - Automatic cleanup of expired provider references
  - Proper memory management
- âœ… Unit tests:
  - Basic functionality testing
  - Edge case handling
  - Thread safety verification
- âœ… Example program demonstrating basic registry operations

- [ ] API stabilization

### Phase 5: SDK Integration & Release
- [ ] VCV Rack SDK integration
- [ ] Final documentation
- [ ] Release preparation

## Known Issues

No significant issues have been encountered during implementation so far. Initial challenges with the singleton implementation (related to destructor visibility for std::make_shared) were resolved.

Potential areas to monitor:

1. **Performance Impact**: We need to ensure registry operations remain efficient even with a large number of topics and providers.

2. **Memory Management**: While the weak reference system works well, we should monitor for any potential memory leaks or reference cycles.

3. **Thread Safety**: Current mutex-based approach is working, but we should continually evaluate if it scales well with increased concurrency.

## Next Milestones

1. **Sprint 2: Subscriber Implementation** - Define and implement the subscriber interface and subscription management in the broker.

2. **Sprint 2: Lifecycle Integration** - Enhance the lifecycle integration for subscribers to ensure proper cleanup on module removal.

3. **Sprint 3: Message Structure** - Define the message structure and prepare for adding serialization support.

4. **Sprint 3: Serialization** - Integrate MessagePack for efficient data exchange.
