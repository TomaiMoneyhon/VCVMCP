## Current Status Summary

We have successfully completed Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the MCP development. The core framework, message exchange system, reference implementations, and comprehensive documentation are now complete.

With Sprint 7 now in progress, we have addressed a critical thread safety issue in the RingBuffer implementation:

1. **RingBuffer Thread Safety Improvements**
   - Identified and fixed a critical race condition in the RingBuffer implementation
   - Developed a specialized Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) implementation with proper memory ordering
   - Validated correctness with comprehensive test suite including stress tests and memory ordering tests
   - Achieved ~980,000 messages/second throughput with perfect reliability
   - Consolidated and optimized test suite for better maintainability
   - Documented best practices for SPSC usage in the MCP context
   - Updated system pattern documentation with clear implementation guidance

2. **Performance Testing Framework**
   - Developed a stress testing framework for concurrent operations
   - Created benchmarking tools to measure throughput and reliability
   - Established baseline performance metrics for the MCP system
   - Created consistent patterns for performance reporting

3. **Code Optimization & Cleanup**
   - Removed unused external libraries (msgpack-c and msgpack-cpp)
   - Standardized on msgpack11 as the sole MessagePack implementation
   - Consolidated duplicate test files for better organization
   - Clarified status of JSON serialization in documentation

## Current Focus

Our current focus remains on Sprint 7: Performance & Scalability Testing. With the RingBuffer issue now resolved, we need to:
1. Apply the same rigorous testing to other components of the system
2. Benchmark MCP operations impact on audio thread CPU usage
3. Test Broker performance under load
4. Identify and address remaining performance bottlenecks
5. Begin integration with the VCV Plugin API

## Known Issues

1. ✅ Fixed: Bad_weak_ptr exception during program termination in reference implementation examples
2. ✅ Fixed: RingBuffer thread safety issue in high-concurrency scenarios
3. ⬜ Need to benchmark message dispatch under load
4. ⬜ Need to formalize error handling patterns based on testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete performance benchmarking across all system components
2. Apply thread safety testing methodologies to all critical components
3. Optimize message dispatch for efficiency
4. Begin integration with VCV Plugin API
5. Prepare for final API refinements based on testing
